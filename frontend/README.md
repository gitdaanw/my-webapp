# own-website
https://weerheim.eu

This repo is created for my school project for my HBO Software Engineering. 
In this module we need to create the frontend of a webapplication using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The website is created with the goal to showcase my own pictures. There is a gallery for the pictures, a embedded Youtube video and the option to add a demo picture. 
Adding of other pictures is blocked to prevent legal issues when pictures other then my own are added. 

The repo comes without a database, you will get your own upon running the code. Using the below steps will give you the seed data. 

# To run the application clone the code and follow the below steps
npm install
node backend/scripts/seed-pictures.js
node backend/main.js
